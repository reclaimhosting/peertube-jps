# PeerTube for Reclaim Cloud
PeerTube, developed by Framasoft, is the free and decentralized alternative to video platforms. Anyone with a modicum of technical skills can host a PeerTube server, aka an instance. Each instance hosts its users and their videos. In this way, every instance is created, moderated and maintained independently by various administrators.
